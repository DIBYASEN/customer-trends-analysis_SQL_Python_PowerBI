# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
**Python | SQL | Power BI**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to uncover purchasing patterns, customer segmentation, and product performance insights. The analysis was performed using **Python for data cleaning and feature engineering**, **SQL for querying insights**, and **Power BI for interactive visualizations**.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate an **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, from raw data to business-ready dashboards.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- SQL (Data querying & aggregation)
- Power BI (Dashboard & visualization)
- Excel / CSV (Data source)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer shopping information such as:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender)
- Product categories
- Purchase amount
- Review ratings
- Purchase behavior patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
- Handled missing values using **group-based median imputation**
- Converted data types for analysis
- Created new features such as **Age Groups** using quartile-based segmentation (`qcut`)
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### 2️⃣ Data Analysis Using SQL
- Category-wise sales analysis
- Customer spending behavior analysis
- Average review ratings by category
- Purchase frequency analysis using `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, and aggregate functions

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Built an **interactive dashboard**
- Visualized:
  - Customer segmentation by age group
  - Category-wise performance
  - Spending trends
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain age groups show higher purchasing frequency and spending
- Specific product categories drive the majority of sales
- Review ratings vary significantly across categories
- Customer segmentation helps identify high-value customer groups
